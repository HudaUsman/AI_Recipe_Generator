Project Status
This project is currently under development. The Recipe Generator is a web application that allows users to discover recipes based on ingredients, search for specific dishes, and get random recipe suggestions. I am actively working on improving my skills in frontend development and plan to incorporate a basic backend for better functionality.

Features
> Search recipes by ingredients ,
> Find recipes by dish name ,
> Get a random recipe suggestion ,

Planned Features
I am working on enhancing the user experience with the following updates:
> Show Multiple Recipes: Instead of displaying only one recipe, users will see multiple options to choose from ,
> Next Recipe Option: Users can browse through different recipes if they are not satisfied with the first suggestion 

Technologies Used
> Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
> API: Spoonacular API (for fetching real-world recipes)
